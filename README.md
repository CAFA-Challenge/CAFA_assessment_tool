# Precision-Recall Assessment of Protein Function Prediction

## Introduction
Critical Assessment of Function Annotation (CAFA), is a community-wide challenge designed to provide a large-scale assessment of computational methods dedicated to predicting protein function.

More information can be found at http://biofunctionprediction.org/cafa/ as well as the CAFA2 paper (Jiang et al, 2016)

This toolset provides an assessment for CAFA submissions based on precision and recall. 


## Dependencies
 - Python 2.7 or Python 3
 - Python packages:
 1. Biopython (Bio)
 2. yaml
 3. matplotlib 
 4. seaborn

## Main Functions
 We provide two main functions to assist in the evaluation of GO-term prediction within the scope of CAFA, the main assessment function and the plot function.
 - `assess_main.py` 
	- Only input needed is the configuration file `config.yaml`, where four parameters are specified.
	- First parameter `file`: prediction file formatted according to [CAFA3 formats](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn5840147/wiki/402192)
	- Second parameter `obo`: path of the gene ontology obo file, the latest version can be downloaded [here](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/go.obo). Note that the obo file used here should not be older than the one used in the prediction.
	- Third parameter `benchmark`: directory of the benchmark folder. Specific formats are required for the benchmark folder, including two sub-directories: groundtruth and lists. Please refer to auxiliary function `benchmark_folder.py` for the creation of this folder, as well as the genral creation of benchmarks. An example benchmark folder is given in this repository `./precrec/benchmark`
	- Fourth parameter `results`: Folder where results are saved. A `pr_rc` folder will be created within the results folder.
	- Note that only the first part `assess` of the configuration file is used here, the rest of the configuration file can be ignored for this function	
 - `plot.py`


## Auxiliary Functions 
 CAFA3 released its [protein targets](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn6172284) in September 2016. Each protein target has a unique CAFA3 ID. To run the above assessment function, each protein should be represented by its CAFA3 ID. However, the benchmark proteins generated by the [benchmark creation tool](https://github.com/nguyenngochuy91/CAFA_benchmark) are identified by UniProt Accession IDs. 
Therefore, we here provide functions to convert between UniProt IDs and CAFA3 IDs. We also provide a function that converts benchmark files generated by the [benchmark creation tool](https://github.com/nguyenngochuy91/CAFA_benchmark) to a benchmark folder that can feed into this program.
 - `benchmark_folder.py`
 - `./ID_conversion/ID_conversion.py`
