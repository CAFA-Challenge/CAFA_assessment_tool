## Additional scripts used in CAFA3

This folder contains scripts to evaluate CAFApi submissions. 
Run `python tc_main_forTCfiles.py -h` for help. The script gives you an option to either output results based on Precision-Recall curves or ROC curves. Metrics based on PR curves are AP (Average Precision), F1 and Fmax.
